  <h1>Minecraft Bedwars Plugin</h1>
  <p>This is a plugin for the Java edition of Minecraft that recreates the popular game mode called "Bedwars". In Bedwars, multiple players or teams battle against each other, aiming to destroy each other's beds to prevent respawning after death.</p>
  
  <h2>Project Details</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers: Adam and Fabian</li>
    <li>GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/AdamKITZ/SWP_Fabi-Adam">https://github.com/AdamKITZ/SWP_Fabi-Adam</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the provided zip file.</li>
    <li>Extract the zip file, which contains another zipped file called "minecraft".</li>
    <li>Run the "00start.bat" file to start the server locally, or join the server at "kitzweb.com".</li>
    <li>In the game, click on the sign in front of you to teleport to the bedwars_lobby.</li>
    <li>Wait in the lobby for other players to join.</li>
    <li>When enough players have joined, a countdown will start, and you will be teleported to the actual game world (world_bedwars).</li>
    <li>Play the game, gather resources, and try to destroy other players' beds.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Plugin States</h2>
  <p>The plugin has different states that control the flow of the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lobby State: Players join the lobby world and wait for more players to join.</li>
    <li>Ingame State: The game starts, and players are teleported to their team spawns in the battle world.</li>
    <li>Ending State: One team wins, the world resets, and the server is available for another round.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Involved Classes</h2>
  <p>The plugin contains several classes that handle different aspects of the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Commands: Contains logic for server administrator commands.</li>
    <li>GameStateManager | LobbyState | IngameState | EndingState: Manage and handle game states.</li>
    <li>Listeners: Handle events such as block breaks, player deaths, and world changes.</li>
    <li>Object classes (e.g., Team): Store information about teams, players, and spawns.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Current Progress</h2>
  <p>The plugin is currently in development by Adam and Fabian. Please refer to the GitHub repository for the latest updates and progress.</p>
