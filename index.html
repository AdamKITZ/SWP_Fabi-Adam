    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>
      Together, AdamKITZ and stampFabian are developing a plugin for the well-known Java game Minecraft: Java Edition.
      The plugin aims to recreate the popular game mode called "Bedwars" where players or teams battle against each other.
      The objective is to destroy other players' beds to prevent them from respawning after death.

    <h2>First Setup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the provided zip file.</li>
      <li>Extract the zip file, which contains another zipped file called "minecraft".</li>
      <li>You can either use this file and start "00start.bat" to join the server at "localhost".</li>
      <li>If you prefer not to set up the server on your PC, you can join the server hosted by Fabian at "kitzweb.com".</li>
    </ol>

  <section id="gameplay">
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>After joining the server, you will be in the first world.</li>
      <li>Click on the sign in front of you to teleport to the "bedwars_lobby" where you wait for other players to join.</li>
      <li>A countdown will start, and once it's over, you will be teleported to the actual game world "world_bedwars".</li>
      <li>In the game world, you should be teleported to your team's color and receive a message stating your team.</li>
      <li>Gather resources and strategize to destroy other teams' beds and emerge victorious.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that the plugin is still a work in progress, so more features will be added in the future.</li>
